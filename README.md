Experienced DevOps/Platform engineer with a bias toward automation, simplicity, and trust.
I don’t believe in hero culture or over-engineering. My work is driven by laziness in its best form: building things once, making them reliable, and letting them run with minimal babysitting.

I’ve worked across clouds, clusters, and continents. I enjoy fixing messes others avoid — legacy Terraform states, forgotten Helm releases, half-migrated secrets, and everything in-between.
Think of me as the platform janitor: I come in quietly, clean things up, set up self-healing systems, and leave things better than I found them.

What I value:
 • Automation > repetition
 • Processes that trust people, not gate them
 • Stable systems over shiny ones
 • Honest communication, low ego, high ownership

I’m looking ( might be ) for challenging and bold projects — places where seniority means clarity, not constant firefighting.
